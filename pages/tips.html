                        <h2>Mommi, Clapham</h2>
                        Mommi, a Japanese-Peruvian fusion haven, transcends the ordinary dining experience with its emphasis on exceptional shared plates, impeccable service, inventive cocktails, and a clever blend of cuisines. Noteworthy dishes on the menu include the exquisite rare ahi tuna with whipped avocado, coriander, cucumber kimchi, and a honey dressing, as well as the roasted cauliflower steak featuring salt-baked fennel, cauliflower puree, aji panca-roasted chickpeas, and chimichurri.<br>
                        <br>What truly sets this Clapham gem apart is its commitment to gluten-free options across the entire menu, making it an inclusive haven for those with dietary preferences. Vegans also have an abundance of delectable choices. Rumor has it that Mommi hosts a remarkable bottomless brunch, and for those seeking a delightful happy hour, Fridays and Saturdays from 10 pm to 12 am offer margaritas for a mere five quid. Buenas noches indeed!<br>

                        <h2>Arepa & Co, Stockwell</h2>
                        A definite top choice for gluten-free dining, Arepa & Co. holds a special place in my heart. Venezuelan cuisine inherently leans towards gluten-free options, and the star of their menu, the specialty arepas, perfectly encapsulates this. For the uninitiated, arepas can be likened to a cornbread pitta, generously stuffed with delectable fillings like shredded beef, plantain, and guacamole – a combination not to be underestimated.<br>
                        <br>Pair these delightful arepas with a serving of yuca fries and tajadas for a satisfying meal. To elevate the experience, I highly recommend exploring their excellent cocktail menu, where a suitable amount of rum and tequila awaits your palate. Arepa & Co. ensures that gluten-free dining is not just an option but a delightful journey into Venezuelan flavors.<br>

                        These experts in batter (pun intended) have mastered the art of tempting taste buds, ensuring that no coeliac is left out. Every item on their menu caters to even the most stringent gluten-free diets, welcoming everyone with open arms. And who can resist the charm of a waffle?<br>
                        <br>Distinguished for their 'posh' gluten-free waffles, the offerings go far beyond the ordinary. Take, for example, the James, Jules & the Giant Peach – a warm waffle adorned with cinnamon sugar, topped with smoked bacon, caramelized peach, rosemary honey, cream cheese frosting, and a pistachio crumb. For the savory enthusiasts, the Club Waffle beckons with smoked bacon, fried chicken, garlic aioli, bloody mary relish, and crisp baby gem lettuce, all layered between their signature mozzarella and thyme-stuffed waffle. Mouthwatering, isn't it? And fear not, there's a dedicated vegan menu for those steering clear of both animal products and gluten.<br>
                        <br>Utter Waffle, having graduated from their beloved food truck in various city markets, now proudly resides in their brick-and-mortar establishment in Herne Hill. Scaling new heights, they offer 90 minutes of bottomless bubbles alongside any main course, any time, any day – all for just £37.50 (£42 for a main and dessert). Gluten-free indulgence at its finest!<br>

                        <br>The waffles featuring honey-truffle fried chicken, generous drizzles of maple syrup, and whipped butter left us in awe. Equally impressive were the pancakes adorned with grilled peaches, blueberry compote, and more maple syrup. The menu even boasts gluten-free churros, a delightful surprise for aficionados.<br>
                        <br>This gluten-free haven doesn't only excel in cuisine; their cocktails pack a punch, even before noon. With an extensive collection of fine and rare tequilas, particularly the Agavaria, Los Mochis' bar space exudes charm. As a devoted tequila enthusiast, selecting a drink was a delightful challenge.
