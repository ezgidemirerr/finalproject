                        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                        250g unsalted butter, cubed, plus extra for the tin<br>
                        250g dark chocolate, roughly chopped<br>
                        4 large eggs<br>
                        300g golden caster sugar<br>
                        ½ tsp vanilla extract or paste<br>
                        100g gluten-free plain flour, sieved<br>
                        60g cocoa powder<br>
                        ½ tsp fine sea salt<br>
                        150g milk chocolate, roughly cut into chunks<br>
                        <h2>Method</h2>
                        Preheat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Butter a 30cm x 20cm non-stick tin, line the base with non-stick baking parchment. Fill a saucepan one-third full with water, bring to a simmer, and place a heatproof bowl on top. Gently melt butter and chocolate over low heat, stirring occasionally. Avoid letting it catch and burn. Remove from heat and let it cool slightly. Beat eggs and sugar with an electric whisk for 8-10 mins until thick enough to leave a trail. Gently fold in the cooled melted chocolate and vanilla, followed by flour, cocoa, and salt. Finally, fold in chocolate chunks. Pour the brownie batter into the lined tin, bake in the center of the oven for 30-35 mins. Let it cool a bit in the tin before cutting into 12 squares.

                        <h4>For the spice mix</h4>

                        2 tbsp cumin seeds<br>
                        1 tbsp coriander seeds<br>
                        1 tsp black peppercorns<br>

                        <h2>Method</h2>
                        Begin by preparing the spice mix. Toast cumin seeds, coriander seeds, and peppercorns in a dry frying pan. Add remaining spice mix ingredients, excluding cornflour, and grind. Stir in cornflour. For pickled onions, toss onions with lime juice and salt, allowing them to soften. In a frying pan crumble in the mince. Cook for 15-20 mins, stirring occasionally. Sprinkle half the spice mix, cook for 2 mins.  To assemble tacos, toast tortillas and place them on a serving plate. Spoon the mince into a bowl and serve other ingredients separately for assembly or directly spoon mince into tortillas, topping with avocado, tomato, cheese (if using), pickled onions, and crushed tortilla chips. Serve lime wedges on the side for squeezing over.

                        50g self-raising flour<br>
                        50g wholemeal or wholegrain flour<br>
                        2 small eggs, separated<br>

                        In a bowl or wide jug, sift the flours, adding any bits back into the bowl. Stir in egg yolks and a splash of milk to form a thick paste. Gradually add the remaining milk to avoid lumps. Whisk egg whites until stiff peaks form, then carefully fold them into the batter, preserving the air. Heat a non-stick pan over medium heat, pour enough batter for a 10 cm pancake, and cook for just under a minute until bubbles appear and edges dry. Carefully flip the pancake; if it's a bit wet, leave it longer. Keep warm while making remaining pancakes. Serve with your favorite healthy toppings.

                        In a saucepan over medium heat, melt 1 tbsp coconut oil and sauté 1 chopped onion for 5 mins until softened.

                        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                        400g gluten-free bread flour<br>

                        5 tbsp olive oil<br>

                        <h4>For the sauce & topping</h4><br>
                        2 tbsp olive oil<br>
                        1 small onion, finely chopped<br>
                        1 x 400g can chopped tomatoes<br>
                        2 tbsp tomato purée<br>
                        1 tsp caster sugar<br>
                        ½ small bunch basil, leaves shredded<br>
                        2 x 125g balls buffalo mozzarella<br>
                        <h2>Method</h2>
                        Preheat the oven to 220C/200 fan/gas 7 with two baking sheets inside. For the sauce, heat oil in a small saucepan, cook onion with a pinch of salt for 10 mins until softened. Add chopped tomatoes, purée, and sugar; simmer gently for 30 mins until reduced and thick, stirring regularly. Blitz the sauce until smooth, season, and stir in basil. For the dough, mix flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and xanthan gum in a large bowl. Make a well, pour in 250ml warm water and olive oil. Store in the fridge for up to 24 hours. Flour two baking sheets, split the dough into two, flatten into 20-25cm rounds. Top with sauce and torn mozzarella. Place on hot baking sheets in the oven; bake for 8-10 mins until crisp around the edges.
